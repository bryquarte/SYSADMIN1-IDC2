**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

  I expected to learn more about System Administration, especially troubleshooting and yes, it exceeded my expectations. I learned even more rather than just troubleshooting.

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

Some of the main topics on this course are the different types of Load balances, Infrastructure Security and about managing files and data. These topics helped me a lot in understanding the subject matter by doing lab activities. I’m not the memorizing type of a person so I really love doing lab activities because it helps me understand better than lecture stuff.

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

Active learning is the most effective strategy in learning that I’ve been doing since day one. Other techniques include hands-on practice at home which really helped me on the lab activities. I guess consistent reviewing of the topics like repetitive reading and summarizing are also a big help on my exams

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

I really do love lab activities or like actual learning. For me, they are a big help in enhancing my learning experience because I can understand much better when I am doing it rather than reading or memorizing stuff during lecture.  

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

The only challenge that I encounter during this subject is getting up early since I am renting quite far from the campus so I needed to wake up early for me to not be late especially on the lab schedule.

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

The promotion of critical thinking and higher-order thinking skills is essential for preparing students for real life challenges. Critical thinking and analysis did help me navigate the complexities of the course System Administration. Engaging in discussions about ethical considerations in system administration helped me understand the complexities of making informed decisions. Challenging us students to create innovative solutions for hypothetical scenarios fosters creativity alongside critical thinking.

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

I think I gained analytical thinking and collaboration skills from this course. Enhanced problem-solviong skills by tackling real-world scenarios allows me for better analysis and decision-making. It improves my collaborative skills through group work which I think we have done once. Documentation also helped me to develop the ability to document processes and systems which is vital for team communication and future reference.  


How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

I plan to enroll in advanced courses related to cybersecurity, cloud computing and network administration to build upon the foundational skills learned. Continuous learning via online tutorials or online courses to stay updated on topics or new trends in system administration is also on the plan.
